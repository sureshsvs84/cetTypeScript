# Level Up Tutorials - React and Redux for Everyone (Typescript Edition)

This is a [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) implementation of Level Up Tutorials Movie Database using React and Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), check their repo to learn more about it.

You can see the videos for the course that builds this application at [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/redux-and-react-for-everyone/).

## Getting started

- Clone this repo
- `git checkout end-of-9 # optional, in case you want to re-write the TS code yourself`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

See the Create React App docs for more details on what else can be done with this app.

## Notes

As this project was created using Typescript instead of plain JS, I took some creative liberties and altered the code ever so slightly from what Scott originally wrote for the course. I still tried to keep as much of the code like the original as possible, which means there could be some minor bits which are not as nice Typescript code as it can be written.

The code is organised as one commit per video from video number 9 (where most of the actual project starts). You can check out each of these checkpoints as a git tag for easier access.

If you find anything that is not inline with the course content or you believe to be wrong, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

If you have any questions, wanna say thanks or chat more about TS or code in general, you can find me on Twitter ([@leomeloxp](https://twitter.com/leomeloxp)), my website [leomeloxp.dev](https://leomeloxp.dev) and on LUT's Slack group (see [LUT's site](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) for the link to their Slack).
